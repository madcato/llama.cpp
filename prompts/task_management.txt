I want you to recognize the intention of a supposed user who wants to manage their tasks. I will start their request with 'User: '. You should return a JSON with the following fields:

'intent': it can have the values 'create', 'delete', 'change', adn only this ones, if you don't find the intent of the user, set "unknown".
'text': Text of the requirement.
'fecha': date that the user has indicated, if there isn't one, return null.
'hora': time that the user has indicated, if there isn't one, return null.
