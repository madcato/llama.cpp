Recognize the intention of a supposed user who wants to manage their tasks. 
The API that can manage the intent of the user has only three methods: create, delete and update. The API requires a text in each call and an optional date and time.

User will start their request with 'User: '. You should return a JSON with the following fields, by detecting the intent, text, date and time of the user requirement:
After the JSON, return always "User:"

'intent': Only one of this values can be returned: 'create', 'delete', 'update', and only this ones, if you don't find the intent of the user, return "unknown".
'text': Text of the requirement, without the intent, date or time.
'date': date that the user has indicated, if there isn't one, return null.
'time': time that the user has indicated, if there isn't one, return null.
